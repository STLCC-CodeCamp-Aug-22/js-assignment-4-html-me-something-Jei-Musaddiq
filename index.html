         <p id="testP"> First off is probably my favorite on the list, Tokyo Ghoul. <br> Ill start off by saying if you are one of those manga snobs "keep it pushing". 
            <br> This is a anime is up first because... well... its fire. This dark anime covers a war that takes place in Tokyo 
             between humans and (human eating) ghouls and is centered around the main character kaneki who's life 
              takes a tragic turn when his "cute tinder date" (Rize) turns out to be a ghoul and LITTERALY EATS HIM... almost. 
               Following this kaneki undergoes a life saving surgery that turns him into a half ghoul and we follow him as his 
                bitter/sweet "Mostly Bitter" story is Unraveled (If you know you know) 
                <br> Overall the story is intense, exciting, and pretty emotional. There are many amazing characters and 
                <br> character developments, as well as some pretty fire fight scenes and heart stopping tragedies. 
               All in all I give it a solid 8.5 / 10 as an anime score but a 10 / 10 as my personal experience score.   </p>

         <h3 id="Hunter x Hunter"> Hunter x Hunter</h3>

         <p> Ok this one doesnt need much explaination, if you dont know why this is on the list <b>Please</b> go do yourself a favor and watch it Asap! 
         From the first intro to the very last episode this show really doesn't miss ðŸ’¯. Everything from fire characters like 
         (Gon, Kurapika, and litteraly the entire phantom troupe), to crazy adventures and great battles, to endless wholesomeness and just the right amount 
         comedic relief is all packed into this show along with so much more. I could and have watched this countless times without even skipping the intro let 
         alone any of the episodes. If i had to give this anime a score its easily a 9.5 / 10 with only a half of a point deducted because the anime will 
         probably never be completed and the place where it leaves off feels like its only the beginning (mostly because it is lol).

        <h3 id="MobPsycho"> Mob Psycho 100</h3>

        width="300" height="240">
        <p> So as I said earlier this isnt a top "whatever" list but, if it were Mob Psycho 100 would be very close to the top. This anime follows our main 
             protagonist Shigeo aka Mob who dispite his ordinary appearance, has very extraordinary psychic abilities. Unforunately due to many emotional and social barriers 
             certain events take place that cause Mob to lose control his power making it extremely difficult to carry out his wish of living a "normal" life like those around him. 
             In my opinion this is one of the few anime that is able to effectively condense so many great elements into 12 episode seasons without it feeling completely rushed. 
             Aside from having a really good story, Mob Psycho includes amazing character developments, some top tier artwork and animation, loads of comedy, and so much more. 
             Overall its really charming and exciting id definitely give it a 10 / 10 for my personal experience and a 8.4 / 10 as an anime.

        <p> So im going to skip the description on this one and just say that i strongly encourage you to go watch this movie if you haven't already 
            (assuming you dont mind sheding a few tears, it's ok i did). This is by far one of my favorite romance anime to date and contrary to 
            the title alluding to this being some sort of mid horror anime, it actually holds a great meaning and is used to deliver a powerful message. 

             Between the beautiful developing friendships and the amazing delivery of a harsh reality I want to eat you pancreas is very encaptivating and 
             dispite some slightly predictable moments will likely have you wishing you could go back and watch it for the first time again. 
             I can easily give this movie a 10/10.
